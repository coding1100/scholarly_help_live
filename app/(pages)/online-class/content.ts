      answer:
        "Yes — but not just anyone. At Scholarly Help, you're not dealing with a random freelancer. You’re hiring a trusted academic team that completes your coursework accurately, on time, and with zero stress on your end",

      question: "How much does it cost to pay someone to take my online class?",

      question: "Can you do my online class for me from start to finish?",
      answer:

      question: "Is it safe to hire Scholarly Help for my online class?",

      question: "Why are you the best class taker?",
      answer:
        "Because we do what others promise but don’t deliver. We don’t disappear after payment, miss deadlines, or outsource your work. Our team handles your course with precision — that’s why we’re called the best class taker by returning clients.",

      question: "Are online classes harder than in-person classes?",
